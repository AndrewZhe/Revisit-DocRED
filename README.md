# Revisit-DocRED

This is the repo for acl22 paper **Does Recommend-Revise Produce Reliable Annotations? An Analysis on Missing Instances in DocRED**

We re-annotated 96 documents from the valid set of DocRED. The re-annotated dataset is ./data/docred/valid_scratch.json

We found there is serious missing issue in DocRED, nearly two-thirds of triples are wrongly labeled as NA.

If using this dataset, please cite this paper and the original paper which proposed DocRED.

I will update the readme soon.
